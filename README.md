## ✨ Features

- **Component-Based Architecture**: Created a well-structured project with separate components and containers folders, implementing an index.js export pattern for cleaner imports. This architecture allowed for better code organization and component reusability across the application.
- **Custom CSS with BEM Methodology**: Implemented the Block Element Modifier (BEM) CSS naming convention for better style organization and maintainability. Used CSS variables for consistent colors and gradients throughout the application, making the design system more coherent.
- **Responsive Design Implementation**: Created a fully responsive website that works seamlessly across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices using media queries. Each section was carefully designed to adapt to different screen sizes while maintaining visual appeal and usability.
